# Changeset Requirement

## Rule
- Every task that adds, modifies, or removes code, configuration, entities, translations, or documentation must include a changeset file unless it falls under an explicit exemption.
- If pending changesets already exist in `.changeset/`, evaluate whether the current change is covered. If not, create an additional changeset.

## How to Create a Changeset
- Create a Markdown file in `.changeset/` with a kebab-case name (for example `.changeset/fix-discovery-reload.md`).
- Use the following format:

```markdown
---
"ha-homewizard-instant-release-tools": patch
---

Short, user-facing summary of the change.
```

- Set the bump type to `patch` for fixes and maintenance, `minor` for new features, or `major` for breaking changes.
- Write the summary as a single sentence starting with a verb: `Add ...`, `Fix ...`, `Remove ...`, or `Change ...`.
- Consult the `release-management` skill and `.changeset/README.md` for workflow details.

## Exemptions (No Changeset Needed)
- Purely editorial fixes to comments or docstrings with no behavior change.
- Changes that only affect CI workflows, dev tooling, or test infrastructure with no user-visible impact.
- The automated `Release` PR opened by the Changesets GitHub Action.

## Multiple Changes in One Task
- Create one changeset per logical change. A task that fixes a bug and adds a feature should produce two changeset files.

## Updating an Existing Changeset
- If a follow-up edit refines a change that already has a pending changeset, update the existing changeset summary rather than adding a duplicate.

## Verification
- Before considering a task complete, confirm that at least one `.changeset/*.md` file, excluding `README.md` and `config.json`, exists for the current change, or that an exemption applies.
